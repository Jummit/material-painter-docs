Texturing Workflow
==================

* Create and UV-unwrap the mesh in Blender
* Optionally, bake AO and normal from high to lowpoly in Blender
* Make textures in Material Maker
* Bring textures and the model as an obj into Material Painter
* Texture the model in Material Painter
* Export textures to Godot Engine or elsewhere
