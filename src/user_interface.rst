Customizing the Interface
-------------------------

Panels can be repositioned by dragging their titles and moving them above another panel. A panel can be dropped on the edges of another panel to put it beside it, or in the middle to create a tabbed panel.

Layouts can be saved under ``View>Layouts>Save Current`` and loaded by clicking a layout under ``View>Layouts``. Layouts are saved under ``user://layouts``. The layout named ``default`` is used at startup. If you have a custom default layout and want to use the original, you can delete the ``default.json`` file under ``user://layouts``.
