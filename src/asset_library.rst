Asset Library
=============

The asset library holds global and per-project textures, brushes, materials and effects. Assets created, deleted, tagged and searched.
You can see the name, tag and location of an asset by hovering over it.

Adding and Deleting Assets
--------------------------

To add images, effects and HDRIs to the global library, drag any number of files onto the asset library. To add assets to the local library, put them in the folder of the asset type inside the ``assets`` folder next to your project file.

Materials can be created by right clicking a Material Layer or a Material Folder and selecting ``Save To Library``.

To delete the selected assets, right click and choose ``Delete``.

Tags
----

Each asset has tags automatically assigned by it's name and type. The tags of the selected assets can be modified by right clicking and choosing ``Add Tag`` or ``Remove Tag``.

When searching, all assets that have tags that include the searched words are shown.

Using Assets
------------

Materials, textures and effects can be dropped into the :ref:`Layer Stack <doc_layer_stack>`.
To use a HDRI, drop it onto the viewport. To make it visible, enable ``Show Background`` in the ``View`` menu.
